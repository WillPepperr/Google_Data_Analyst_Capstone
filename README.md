<h1>Cyclistic User Data Summary</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this simulated work project, I was given user data for a mock company named Cyclistic which provided bike rentals in Chicago. My task was to analyze the data and find how subscribers use the service differ from users who pay for each ride individually. Finally, I was aked to give data-based recomendations on how to convert more of the "Casual" riders to Subscribers of the service.

- <b>Power BI<b> 
- <b>MySQL
- <b>Excel
- <b>Powerpoint</b>



<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

The data I needed was located in the form of 4 .CSV files. Some of which were too big to work with in Excel. I decided to import them into a MySQL database.

Using the import wizard on MySQL workbench was taking too long to import, so I decided to use the command line client to import the data. <br/>

<br />
I then created the table with the inteded value types for the columns and imported the 4 .CSV files into a single table. <br/>
